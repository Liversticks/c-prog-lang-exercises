# Testing `word-count`

- Run on empty input/EOF
- Run on input that only consists of whitespace
- Run on one-word input
- Run on multi-word, multi-line input

Often, input consisting of special characters can break programs. This includes most characters outside of the alphanumeric ones (whitespace, punctuation, characters from other languages).
